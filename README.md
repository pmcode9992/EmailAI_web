How to Locally Host a Website
Follow these steps to locally host a website using npm and Node.js:

Clone Repository:
Clone your Git repository that contains the website source code to your local machine. You can use the following command:

```terminal
git clone <repository-url>
```
Navigate to Project Directory:
Change your working directory to the project folder using the cd command:

```terminal
cd <project-directory>
```
Install Dependencies:
Install the required dependencies for your website using npm. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Run the following command to install the dependencies specified in the package.json file:

```terminal
npm install
```
Run Development Server:
To start a local development server and preview your website, use the following npm command:

```terminal
npm run dev
```
This command will typically start a development server and show you an address where your website is being hosted locally (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Open in Browser:
Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the local address provided by the development server. For example, if the server is running on http://localhost:3000, enter this URL in your browser's address bar and hit Enter.

View Your Locally Hosted Website:
Your website should now be accessible in your browser through the local server. You can interact with and test your website just as if it were hosted online.
